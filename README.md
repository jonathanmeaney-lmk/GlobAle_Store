**The 'one-stop shop' for finely crafted beers from around the world**

The beer market and average beer consumer have changed drastically over the past decade or so, which has led to hundreds of craft beer makers popping up all over the world, as well as the emergence of longer-standing, small-scale brewers who have risen to prominence due to the high quality of their beers. 

No longer satisfied with having a slim choice between the 'super brands' at their local bar or supermarket, beer consumers are demanding a wider selection, higher quality and varied tastes, from wheat beers and lagers, to Indian Pale Ales (IPAs) and coffee stouts. The sheer multitude of options now available to beer drinkers on supermarket shelves and on tap or behind the counter of many bars is evidence of how much the market and consumer has changed. 

In many ways, modern beer consumers have become more like wine enthusiasts â€“ amateur connoisseurs with a keen interest in ingredients, blends, colors, quality, the origin of the beer, and detailed "wine-like" descriptions of a beer's taste. Friends' conversations over a beer are now often about the beers themselves, with each offering recommendations to "try this" and "try that".  At the same time, the e-commerce market continues to grow, with many consumers turning to the Internet to buy everything from clothes, music and electronics, to take-out meals, groceries and beer. 

In response to these market changes, the GlobALE digital beer store has been established as a "one-stop shop" for the modern beer fan eager to try beers from around the world. GlobALE offers a wide selection of traditional and craft beers, available to be searched by category or country. Users have access to a simple-to-use interface adapted to varied screen sizes for improved UX (laptop, tablet or phone), which allows them to easily browse, select and buy beer with a few clicks of their mouse, and have it delivered to their doorstep. GlobALE is a celebration of the fine craft undertaken by beer makers from around the world, from Bogota to Dublin, from California to Tokyo and beyond -- offering customers a "Passport to Beeradise".
